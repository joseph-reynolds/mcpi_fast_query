README for experiment/mcpi_query_performance.py

This subdirectory contains the original experimental code 
for the speedups.  It is Python 2.7 only and has no references
to the picraft project.
I basically took the final version of this experiment
(the one using multiple threads and keeping the socket full)
for the library version.

It also contains some fun doodles that really should be
separated out as examples.
